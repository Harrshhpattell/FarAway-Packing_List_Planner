# Packing List Planner    
The Packing List Planner is a **React**-based web application that allows users to create a list of items they need to pack for their upcoming trips. Whether it's a weekend getaway or a long vacation, this app helps users stay organized by providing a simple and efficient way to manage their packing list.     

## Features
